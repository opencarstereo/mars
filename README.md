# Open Car Stereo - Mars

UI for Open Car Stereo

## Running

You'll need `bluez` installed and running in your system. For development I use `pipewire` with `wireplumber` and `pipewire-pulse` to emulate the bluetooth device wich the phone will connect to.

- Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
- Run: `flutter run`
